* On The Little Schemer

This work collect my code during the study of TLS by Friedman and
Felleisen. Much of it is the code written in the book, a small piece
is about the exercises presented in the previous revision of the TSL,
namely The Little Lisper.

<2012-04-06 Fri> Introduce the implementation of the Y-combinator in
a statically typed language, that is Java.
