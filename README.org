* Lisp Labs From Books
  This is my laboratory where I hope to practice Lisp and functional

  The repository structure is as follow:
  
** for every book or article that I'll use there will be a corresponding folder
   In every folder I try to put all the source that implement the
   study content.
** Under the root folder I'll try to keep a document written in Latex
   In this document there will my reasoning about problems

* Books
** The Little Schemer
